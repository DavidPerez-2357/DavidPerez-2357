# 🎯 Building Code, Building Myself
I’m a young developer passionate about programming and technology. I learn new languages and frameworks quickly and adapt well within development teams. Every day, I keep learning to stay up to date with the latest trends and innovations in this amazing field.

  ### 🚀 How It All Started  
  I’ve always been interested in computers, but when I discovered **web development**, I instantly knew it was my path. Since the age of 17, I’ve pursued this passion relentlessly, deepening my knowledge, exploring new tools, and continuously improving my skills.

  ### 🎯 My Goal  
  My goal is to keep growing as a programmer, gaining new experiences, collaborating with great teams, and becoming the best version of myself. I strive to write clean, efficient code and follow best practices to deliver high-quality work.

  ### 📖 Studies
- I am currently studying the Microdegree in Advanced Algorithm Programming at UNED to deepen my understanding of complex problem-solving and software optimization.
  
- In 2025, I have completed a Higher Vocational Training degree in **Web Application Development**, where I developed a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, MySQL, React, Angular, Django, and Tailwind CSS. I focused on creating responsive and efficient web applications and learned to work with modern frameworks and databases.
  
- In 2023, I earned an Intermediate Vocational Training degree in **Microcomputer Systems and Networks**, which provided me with solid technical knowledge in computer maintenance, operating systems, and networking. 

### 💼 Experience
I have gained practical experience as a web developer through several internships and projects. At Glenwood Media Kft. in Budapest, I improved the accessibility and design of digital newspapers, developing modern, user-friendly interfaces using PHP, HTML, and CSS. At Fundación Loyola ACE, I contributed to building and optimizing a library management web application, enhancing both **performance and usability**. These experiences have strengthened my technical expertise and my ability to work collaboratively within development teams.
